# Sample bitfloor trader implementation in Python

To use on windows some environment variables may be needed:
(trader.python) is the directory I put this entire project in.

echo PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\python27\;C:\python27\libs\;C:\python27\trader.python\lib\
echo PATH=%PATH%;C:\python27\

Create a new API key on bitfloor. Remember the passphrase. It will be required to use your API key.

You need to put your api and secret keys into a json file in the keys directory.
example.json
{
    "key": "0d600b0b-3b51-4261-ab5f-55337547",
    "secret": "xmW0mUxxaCVj+QNFJDGNSOy/zVd4za/kbZ+6OA9MQgusJadg2yh1gf9hgf2eg22JjvSjd8dgdBhLgU9g==",
    "passphrase": "anAPIpasswordforsafety"
}

All scripts located in bin/
API Framework located in lib/

Call any script by opening a command window (cmd.exe) and typing:
	python simple.py
