# Sample bitfloor trader implementation in Python

To use on windows some environment variables may be needed:
(trader.python) is the directory I put this entire project in.

echo PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\python27\;C:\python27\libs\;C:\python27\trader.python\lib\
echo PATH=%PATH%;C:\python27\

Create a new API key on the bitfloor website. Remember the passphrase. It will be required to use your API key.

encrypt_apikey.py:  	You need to generate encrypted keys beforehand with the encrypt_apikey.py command

	Use bitfloor as the site name for Bitfloor
	Use mtgox as the site name for Mt. Gox	
	Where it says "Enter an encryption password: (This is the password required to execute trades)"
		-For Bitfloor this is your passphrase that you entered on the website.
		-For mtgox You can create your own password, just make sure to remember it.

All scripts located in bin/
API Framework located in lib/

INSTRUCTIONS:
Call any script by opening a command window (cmd.exe) and typing:
